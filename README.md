# PhD Defense Prep Tools

In this repository, I will try to put all the help I created for myself for my _viva_
(or PhD defense, however you want to call it). At the moment it only contains one 
document intended for you to sumarise your entire document in a few pages. 

`revisionThesis.xlsx`. It contains all the page numbers in your thesis. 
The idea is to print it out and write in each cell a summary of said page. 
For example: 

|  |
|:-------------|
| **p075**  Fig. 3.3: Complete diagram for method X |
| **p076**  Method X's limitations and caveats |
| **p077**  BLANK |
| **p078**  CH4. Method Y: Motivation & Intro |

This document should give you an _at-a-glance_ overview of your entire 
document and will help you locate any page or section easily. 

You can also print this again and bring it empty to your defense. Then all 
comments and corrections can be written in them.
